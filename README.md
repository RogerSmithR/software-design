# CPSC 8700 Assignment 3
Write a program in python scripting language using UML class diagram 
provided below. Do not forget that constructors are often not shown in the UML diagram. For each 
concrete class, please provide a default constructor and a parameterized constructor. We have looked at 
the similar code in C++, now you will implement it in python. You will also demonstrate that your 
program works by instantiating various objects and calling all operations to show they are functional. 
Program has to work on SoC Linux machines.
